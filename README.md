A structured workspace template for planning computer hardware upgrades with Claude Code. Whether you're upgrading a gaming PC, workstation, homelab server, or managing multiple machines, this template provides an organized environment for AI-assisted hardware planning.

## Features

- **Structured context gathering** - Systematic collection of user preferences, budget constraints, and requirements
- **Hardware profiling** - Document current specs for compatibility analysis
- **Multi-machine support** - Plan upgrades for multiple computers in one workspace
- **Formal estimates** - Generate VAT-compliant quotes for business use
- **Currency localization** - All outputs in your preferred currency
- **Privacy-aware** - Tools to redact sensitive data before sharing

## Quick Start

1. **Use this template** - Click the green "Use this template" button above
2. **Clone your new repo** - `git clone <your-repo-url>`
3. **Open with Claude Code** - `cd Claude-Rig-Planner && claude`
4. **Run setup** - Type `/setup` to begin the initial interview

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setup` | Initial interview to gather your preferences, budget, and requirements |
| `/profile` | Scan and document hardware specifications for a machine |
| `/analyze` | Run compatibility and bottleneck analysis |
| `/recommend` | Generate upgrade recommendations within your budget |
| `/estimate` | Create formal cost estimates (VAT-compliant if needed) |
| `/compare` | Compare specific components side-by-side |

## Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
Run `/setup` to complete the initial interview. The agent will ask about:
- Your location and preferred currency
- Budget constraints (total and per-component)
- Preferred vendors and brands
- Use case (gaming, AI/ML, content creation, etc.)
- Business context (if estimates need VAT formatting)

### 2. Hardware Profiling
Run `/profile` to document your current hardware. The agent can:
- Scan local machines directly
- Connect via SSH to network machines
- Process screenshots or exports you place in `/inputs/`
- Accept manual specification input

### 3. Analysis & Recommendations
Run `/analyze` to identify bottlenecks and upgrade opportunities, then `/recommend` to get specific component suggestions within your budget.

### 4. Estimates
Run `/estimate` to generate formal quotes. Business users can get VAT-compliant estimates suitable for accountant review or internal approval.

## Providing Input

Place files in the `/inputs/` directory for the agent to process:
- **Screenshots** - Shopping cart images, spec screenshots
- **System exports** - JSON/CSV from hardware detection tools
- **Quotes** - Existing quotes or invoices for comparison

## Recommended MCP Servers

For enhanced functionality, consider installing these MCP servers:

| MCP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Context7** | Up-to-date hardware specifications |
| **TIME** | Accurate date/time for profiles and estimates |
| **Browser/WebFetch** | Retrieve current pricing from vendors |
| **Notion** | Export documents to Notion |
| **Resend** | Email estimates to yourself or accountant |

See [agent-instructions/mcp-recommendations.md](agent-instructions/mcp-recommendations.md) for setup details.

## Multi-Machine Planning

This template supports planning upgrades for multiple computers:
- Each machine gets its own profile in `/context/machines/{name}/`
- Track per-machine and aggregate budgets
- Cross-reference shared components for bulk purchasing
- Generate consolidated reports

## Privacy

Before sharing your workspace:
- The agent will offer to redact serial numbers and sensitive data
- `/inputs/` may contain personal screenshots - review before sharing
- `/context/business.md` contains business details - exclude if sharing publicly
